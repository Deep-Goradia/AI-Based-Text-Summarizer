# AI-Based-Text-Summarizer

A simple yet powerful Python project that automatically generates concise summaries from long paragraphs using extractive text summarization. Built with NLTK, this project reads text from an input file (sample.txt), processes it using NLP techniques like tokenization, stopword removal, and frequency-based sentence scoring, and outputs the summarized text into summary.txt.

This project demonstrates the use of Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing to enhance text understanding and information extraction.
